        Mrs Stella (RIP) always envisioned a better Uganda and a better community in an all-round fashion through her efforts and career background as a tutor. She was so passionate a teacher and transformed many lives by private mentorships and tutoring until the time of her unfortunate demise.

        The purpose of this non profit is to primarily provide a friendly platform to cultivate attitude change, uplift potential and generate an ability towards positive change in society. The Stella Centre members go out of their way to put monthly contributions in order to help meet some of the basic needs/ requirements needed to develop, strategize and reach out to its stake holders in a bid to achieve its mission.

        The Stella Centre is devout but not limited to creating a sustainable stimulus for social-economic development encompassing career guidance and counselling, mentorship, community participation, capacity building and financial empowerment to bolster the current strategic development goals (2015-2030) and the many different government structure that are already in place.
